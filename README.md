<p>
A web based application to manage mail systems based on Postfix / Dovecot, distributed under an open source license.<br>
But unlike the original Postfix admin it doesn't require to install webserver, database, php and so on.<br>
It was written in Perl and contains all the necessary things in itself.<br>
This solution is more suitable for small systems, like: 1-2 domains and about 1k users.
</p>

## Features list
 - manage domains, aliases, users
 - manage Postfix filters (helo/sender/header/body)
 - manage files in mailbox
 - support Dovecot quotas for mailbox
 - support Dovecot statistic for mailbox
 - web interface based on Qooxdoo (screenshots)
 - access to all the management API through JSON-RPC (see api documentation)
